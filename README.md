# TARDIS-Resource-Pack

Resource pack for the TARDIS v4.2 (and higher) plugin, as well as TARDISWeepingAngels and the Vortex Manipulator

This is a fork of the official texture pack for this plugin, i was never a fan of the super stylised assets as they just aren't really built for the vanilla art style, so i thought i'd make one that fits more for those like myself who use default textures.

This is very early and there will likely be droughts in updates, but i plan to keep updating this over time for the forseeable future.

Some designs may be heavily inspired by existing minecraft mods or addons, however all assets, not including ones i've yet to replace, are either my own or used with permission (as of writing all assets added have been created by me)

# TARDIS-Resource-Pack

Resource pack for the TARDIS v4.2 (and higher) plugin, as well as TARDISWeepingAngels and the Vortex Manipulator

This is a fork of the official texture pack for this plugin, i was never a fan of the super stylised textures included as they really don't fit minecraft whatsoever imo, so i thought i'd make one thats more vanilla themed, slowly changing things where i can to make them closer to vanilla

This is very early and im only gonna update it when i have time and motivation, so if something doesn't have an updated texture or model thats why.

Some designs may be inspired by existing minecraft mods or addons, however no models or textures will be used unless permission is provided
